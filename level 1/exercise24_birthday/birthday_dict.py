# Excercise 24 : Bithday :: part 1 Birthday Dictionary

'''This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.

For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. 
Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. 
When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. 
The interaction should look something like this:

>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.'''

Birthday_dict = {"Albert Einstein" : "1879-3-14", "Benjamin Franklin" : "1706-1-17", "Ada Lovelace" : "1815-12-10"}
print("Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:")
for keys in Birthday_dict:
    print(keys)
def look_up():
    name = input(">>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?")
    if name in Birthday_dict:
        print(Birthday_dict.get(name))
    else:
        print("Sorry, no recrods!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    look_up()
